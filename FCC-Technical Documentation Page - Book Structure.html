<section id="frontmatter" style="margin-left:20%" class="w3-container"> 
    <h2>Front Matter</h2>
    <p>The front matter is the first section of the book that the reader encounters. These pages outline the various technical details as well as some input from the author about what inspired or drove the project. The front matter includes:</p>
    <h3>1. Title page</h3>
    <p>The title page contains the title of the book, the subtitle, the author or authors, and the publisher.</p>
    <h3>2. Copyright Page</h3>
    <p>The copyright page, or edition notice, contains the copyright notice, the Library of Congress catalog identification, the ISBN, the edition, any legal notices, and credits for book design, illustration, photography credits, or to note production entities. The copyright page may contain contact information for individuals seeking to use any portions of the work to request permission.</p>
    <h3>3. Dedication</h3>
    <p>The dedication page allows the author to honor an individual or individuals. The dedication is usually a short sentence or two.</p>
        <h3>4. Table of contents</h3>
    <p>The table of contents outlines the book’s body of work by dividing it into chapters, and sometimes sections or parts. Much thought goes into the titles of the chapters, as the chapter titles can set the tone for the book. When someone quickly glances through the table of contents, they should be able to discern the scope and basic theme of the book.</p>
    <p>And so on.....</p>
    
  </section>

    <section id="bodymatter" style="margin-left:20%" class="w3-container">
      <h2>Body Matter</h2>
      <p>The core content of the book is referred to as the body matter. This is a collection of chapters, sometimes divided up into sections, in which the body of work is organized. In works of fiction, chapters drive the narrative, events, and locations in the story. In nonfiction, chapters might each consist of a singular area of study.</p>
  </section>
  
    <section id="backmatter" style="margin-left:20%" class="w3-container">
        <h2>Back Matter</h2>
      <p>Once the story is completed, it is followed by back matter or end material, those pages that include references pertaining to the core content, as well as an author biography in some cases. Back matter includes:</p>
  
      <h3>1. Afterword or Epilogue</h3>
<p>These are author comments that follow the end of the body matter. These thoughts may summarize the project or the experience of writing it that helps bring closure to the book. The epilogue can help soothe the reader after a particularly harrowing story. Or even serve as a final chapter that helps to wrap up the loose ends of a story.</p>

<h3>2. Appendix or Addendum</h3>
<p>The addendum refers to documents that were added after the body of work that may not have fit in with the narrative or is simply additional information that fortifies the work.

<h3>3. Glossary</h3>
<p>The glossary is an alphabetical list of terms and definitions found within the body matter. These terms may be common terms or specialized terms that refer to a particular field of study.</p>

<h3>4. Bibliography or Endnotes</h3>
<p>The bibliography is the listing of books or literary sources that were cited within the body matter. These sources may be books, magazines, or online sources that were accessed during the research phase. Endnotes resemble footnotes that are found in the back matter instead of at the footer of a page.</p>

<h3>5. Index</h3>
<p>A guide that offers an alphabetical list of terms, people, concepts, or events with the associated page number. The index provides an easy manner to locate key items within the body matter.</p>

  <h3>6. Author biography</h3>
<p>The biography page summarizes the author’s professional background. The biography should be relevant to the publication and also include a few personal facts about the author. Instead of a page at the end, the author’s biography may be on the dust jacket, or on the back cover.</p>
